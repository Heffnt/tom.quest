// TTS time helpers — the 5 a.m. America/New_York day boundary (spec §7).
// Implemented without Intl so behavior is identical in the Convex runtime,
// Node (worker box), and the browser. US DST rules: clocks spring forward at
// 2:00 EST (07:00 UTC) on the second Sunday of March and fall back at 2:00 EDT
// (06:00 UTC) on the first Sunday of November.
//
// THE THREE DAY QUESTIONS (they have different answers before 5 a.m. — mixing
// them up was this module's original sin, caught in review):
//   ttsDayKey(now)      "which TTS day is it right now?"   2 a.m. → yesterday.
//   ttsPrepDay(now)     "which day is a prep run building?" the day of the NEXT
//                       digest — at 4:30 a.m. that's the day STARTING at 5.
//   nyCalendarDayKey(t) "what calendar date is this instant, on a NY clock?"
//                       used for due-date arithmetic, where '2 a.m. belongs to
//                       yesterday' would be wrong.
