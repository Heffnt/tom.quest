# TOM.quest Project Context

Personal website for Tom Heffernan, PhD student in AI at WPI.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 (PostCSS-based, no tailwind.config)
- Geist fonts (Sans + Mono)
- Hosted on Vercel

## Design System
- Background: pure black (#000)
- Text: white (#fff), reduced opacity for secondary (white/60, white/40)
- Animations: fade-in with translateY, defined in globals.css
- Navigation: fixed top bar, underline on active page
- Layout: max-w-3xl centered container, generous whitespace

## File Structure
```
app/
├── page.tsx              # Welcome/home page
├── bio/page.tsx          # Tom's bio, education, research
├── projects/page.tsx     # Placeholder - projects showcase
├── turing/page.tsx       # Placeholder - GPU dashboard
├── data-labeling/page.tsx # Placeholder - labeling tools
├── components/
│   └── Navigation.tsx    # Client component with usePathname
├── globals.css           # Theme + animations
└── layout.tsx            # Root layout with nav
```

## Placeholder Pages
Turing, Data Labeling, and Projects are placeholders awaiting implementation.
- Turing: will be GPU allocation/monitoring dashboard for WPI's Turing HPC
- Data Labeling: will be annotation tools
- Projects: will showcase Tom's work

## Conventions
- Keep styling minimal and elegant
- Use animate-fade-in / animate-fade-in-delay classes for page transitions
- Navigation links use opacity transitions, underline for active state
- All pages follow same structure: min-h-screen, max-w-3xl mx-auto, px-6 py-16
